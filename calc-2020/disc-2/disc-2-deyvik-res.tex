\section{Intro}
Hey Deyvik, great job with the initial post!

For the problem in set B in my initial post, I also solved it in the same way as you, using $u$-sub with $u=4x^2-1$. One thing I've realized recently is that you can also use partial fraction decomposition to solve the problem. While it is definitely more complex and less efficient than $u$-sub straight from the beginning, I noticed some interesting parallels between both methods as I solved the problem.


\section{Solving $\int_{ }^{ }\frac{x^{3}}{4x^{2}-1}dx$}
The fraction is improper, so we first have to divide it

\begin{equation}
  \polylongdiv{x^3}{4x^2-1}
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
  \intertext{The resulting quotient and remainder gives us the two following integrals...}
  &=\int_{ }^{ }\frac{1}{4}xdx+\int_{ }^{ }\frac{\frac{1}{4}x}{4x^{2}-1}dx\\
  \intertext{We can immediately solve the first integral, and factor the second}
  &=\frac{1}{8}x^{2}+\frac{1}{4}\int_{ }^{ }\frac{x}{4x^{2}-1}dx\\
  \intertext{\textbf{Focusing on $\frac{1}{4}\int_{ }^{ }\frac{x}{4x^{2}-1}dx$} we can start with $u$-sub}
  u&=4x^{2}-1\\
  du&=8xdx\\
  \frac{1}{8}du&=xdx\\
  &=\frac{1}{32}\int_{ }^{ }\frac{du}{u}\\
  \intertext{Then integrate!}
  &=\frac{1}{32}\ln\left(\left|u\right|\right)+C\\
  &=\frac{1}{32}\ln\left(\left|4x^{2}-1\right|\right)+C\\
  \intertext{Now we plug in the result back into main and simplify}
  &=\frac{1}{8}x^{2}+\frac{1}{32}\ln\left(\left|4x^{2}-1\right|\right)+C\\
  &=\boxed{\frac{1}{32}\left(4x^{2}+\ln\left(\left|4x^{2}-1\right|\right)\right)+C}
\end{align}

\section{To conclude...}
This method of partial fraction decomp first was definitely more complex and less efficient than just $u$-subbing, as we had to long divide and ended up setting $u=4x^2-1$ on the second integral anyway. But midway through, the $\int_{ }^{ }\frac{1}{4}xdx+\int_{ }^{ }\frac{\frac{1}{4}x}{4x^{2}-1}dx$ looked a lot like the $\frac{1}{32}\left(\int_{ }^{ }du+\int_{ }^{ }\frac{1}{u}du\right)$ that we got from $u$-subbing from the beginning.
