      Hey Aaron! Thank you so much for your speedy reply.

    <div style="padding: 1rem 2rem">
      In regards to your comment about me not providing enough context when answering the question
      <i>"Then determine how long would they have from the moment the
        meteorite hit?"</i>
      in
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>part 3</b></span>, I will say that I did write in my
      initial post
      <i>"we can just use our previous values for total time it takes for
        meteor to fall and time it took to get to 600 km, which weâ€™ve already
        calculated".</i>
      However, I do agree that I should've given more context to where exactly
      I got the value from (i.e. Added from part 1+2).

      Second, I think that using
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> +9.8</b></span>
      instead of
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> -9.8</b></span>
      to represent your acceleration constant isn't really so much a "correction" rather than a "preference" in the
      context of this problem. This is because one, the problem didn't
      explicitly say whether to consider up as positive and down as negative,
      but second, if you interpreted
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> +9.8</b></span>
      as distance <i>towards</i> Houston, then distance away from Houston would have
      to be negative. Therefore, you would have to plugin
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> -36000000</b></span>
      for when the satellite is above houston. In fact, I'd go as far as to
      say that the way that you solved
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>part 1</b></span>
      by seemingly arbitrarily reversing
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 4.8t</b></span>
      to
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> -4.8t</b></span>
      is not only incorrect, but defeats the whole purpose of actually setting
      your gravitational acceleration to
      <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> +9.8</b></span>.
