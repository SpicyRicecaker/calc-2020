# Discussion 14 . Famous curves in Calculus 3

1. Select a function from the list of equations
  - *Animate* the *constant* values in the equation on *Desmos*
  - Make observations
2. Select *3* interesting points, and create a `c(t)=(x(t), y(t))` that matches these points
3. Find the equation of the *tangent line* at all 3 points
4. Find the *second derivative* of the parametric equation using the *formula*
5. Summary
  - How the ocnstants change the shape of your graph and general information/observation about your graph
  - Your "chosen" version of the graph, and info about (x, y, f', f'')
  - Screenshot for screenshots of graph, tangent lines, and points
