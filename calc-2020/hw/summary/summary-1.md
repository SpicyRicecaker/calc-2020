# Summary 1

## Motivation
Math for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 and other disease causing pathogens and mutations using high-resolution melting analysis by Bob Palais, Utah Valley University

## Findings
Feel thermodynamic transition between separated strands of DNA and double strands of DNA, dye reacts to that yet doesn't affect resolution, "High Resolution Melting"

So specific it detects single ACGT difference, but based on math

Flourescence / temperature
## Possible Research Issues

## Conclusion Drawn

## Next steps

## Math
Derivative curves dF/dT, can show the melting curve of Covid-19, th

Can find the critical points and use that  

Temperature vs. Flourenscence

- Hoff's
  - Find chemical Equilibrium using entropy and enthropy, literally just slope and intercept
  - Ind each sequence, look at the neighboring pairs, adding them up using dot products
- Poland's Algorithm
- Beers Law
  - Anything that's flat is 0 derivative
  - Amplitude not needed for fitting stuff in
  - Fit stuff

## Intersting Things and Questions
If you have cough you have good chance of having a lot of other things, but you need to identify what it is
