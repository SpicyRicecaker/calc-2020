Hello Katherine!
Thank you so much for replying to my initial post. 

I want acknowledge your reaffirmation of the fact that Taylor series are not very pratical for functions with a lot of bends, and I also agree with your point that in this situation, Riemann sums were the easiest to calculate and still provided the best result. 

The results of your Riemann Sums calculation after doubling the amount of strips to $n=8$ was extremely surprising to me. This was because the answer of $9.045$ was only $.005$ off of the answer that I got using $n=4$! 

I'll definitely keep the effectiveness of Riemann sums over Taylor series in this problem in mind, or their use in large bounds for functions in general. 

Again, thank you so much for replying to my initial post!

Cheers,

-Andy
