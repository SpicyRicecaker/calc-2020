\section{Topic of Interest}

One topic that really interests me that could be modeled by a DE is the population of the United States.

\section{Data Collection}

For data, I decided to use information from \href{https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/}{Worldometer}, more specifically the rate of yearly population growth rate and total population in 2019.

At the end of 2019, the total population was estimated to be 329,064,917 people, while the yearly population growth rate was estimated to be around $.6\%$ (which translates to $.006$ in decimal form).

This leads me to a differential equation of $\frac{dP}{dt}=.006P$, with a initial point of 2019, 329064917.

\section{Solving the DE}
$$
  \frac{dP}{dt}=.006P
$$
\begin{align}
  \intertext{First bring each variable to one side}
  \frac{dP}{P}                                & =.006dt                     \\
  \intertext{Next we can integrate both sides}
  \int_{ }^{ }\frac{dP}{P}                    & =\int_{ }^{ }.006dt         \\
  \ln\left(P\right)                           & =.006t+C                    \\
  \intertext{Raise $e$ to the power of both sides}
  P                                           & =e^{.006t+C}                \\
  \intertext{Since $e^C$ is a constant we can take it out and set it as one $C$}
  P                                           & =Ce^{.006t}                 \\
  \intertext{Next we can plugin our known value point of $\left(2019,329064917\right)$}
  329064917                                   & =Ce^{.006\left(2019\right)} \\
  \intertext{Then solve for $C$}
  \frac{329064917}{e^{.006\left(2019\right)}} & =C                          \\
  C                                           & \approx1804.007             \\
  \intertext{Plug it back in to get our particular solution}
  \Aboxed{P                                   & =1804.007e^{.006t}}         \\
\end{align}
