        Thanks for replying! The minecraft wiki definitely seems a like great
        place to learn more about the inner-workings of the game.<br />
        One thing that I read browsing the wiki is that piglins only have a 2%
        chance of giving you 4 ender pearls from bartering. What a scam! 😤

        Thanks for replying! I totally agree with the main points in the
        article. Linux seems to have some <i>really</i> deep rabbit holes and
        time sinks tho, so maybe macOS is the sweet spot between. 🙂

        Thanks for sharing the video on how to beat minecraft! Though it is a
        little bit out of date, I still picked up on a few things. <br />
        One thing about minecraft is that there're two editions: java and
        bedrock. While java has more customization options, it's only available
        on desktop. Bedrock on the other hand, is cross-platform! If you want to
        play with your friend who's on mobile, I'd highly suggest looking into
        that. (It does require you to basically buy the game again tho...) 🤔

        That's quite a nice-looking screenshot of your house in minecraft! The
        shaders look absolutely amazing. 😍

        Totally Agree! In some of the major cities, you only see the blue sky
        for a few days a year, if any. In some of the more rural areas the air
        quality is still pretty good tho!
