    I chose to research the Great Chinese Famine of 1959-1961, because, frankly, my dad talks about it all the time. Coming from China, he's read a lot of Chinese history and is very passionate about this subject. 
    
    I've always wondered how a government could be the cause for millions of people dying, and what occured in the minds of the officials of the government as they did what they did. I think that the information is also relavent to present day, as China is a global superpower.

    I think examining primary sources (if there are any) would be a good way to get first person perspectives of what actually happened, however, the censorship of the government and rewriting history would also be a factor to consider when finding sources.
