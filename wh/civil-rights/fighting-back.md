# Fighting Back (1957-1962)

## What was students’ motivation for attending Little Rock Central High School?
- Black children were not getting a chance in their current education system, and they really needed it

## How did students prepare for the first day of school?  What did they expect to happen?  Why didn’t things go as they expected?
- They expected that they would face some harassment but nothing too big
- Things didn't go expected because governor Orval Faubas of Arkansas sent in the national guard to prevent the Little Rock to get pro segregation votes

## How do you explain the mob’s reaction?  What do you think white protestors were trying to accomplish?
- The white protesters didn't want to integrate and so they protested against the little rock nine entering the school
- Some people even came from different cities and states
- The protesters were trying to fear the black students into not coming to school

## What is the role of the president when states and local officials defy federal law?  How did President Eisenhower explain his decision to bring federal troops to Little Rock?  What arguments did he make?
- The president should enforce federal law over state law, especially when the state defies the state law
- To protect the rights of the people, but mostly have court rulings apply over mob rule

## Many segregationists, like Governor Orval Faubus, claimed that the federal government was imposing its will and that states had rights as well.  How would you respond to this argument?
- States do have reserved rights but by the constitution the federal government holds more power than the state government and it should abide by it

## Why was school desegregation so explosive?
- Desegregation was very explosive because of the riots taht happened, and the direct conflict between southern state governments and federal government, including president Eisenhower himself.
