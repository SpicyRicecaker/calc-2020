## Draft #1
- How successful was the Brown v. Board case in desegregating public education?

Although Brown v. Board of Education really shifted the federal perspective in public education, at the local level things were still incredibly segregated. One big problem was the scope of enforcement that the court ruled. "All deliberate speed" is a very abstract amount of time, and even 10 years after it was passed most children still attended segregated schools. Having 9 African American students being able to enter an all-white school in Central High of Arkansas was a huge landmark, but it was clear that there was a lot of resistance from the public, such as city riots and school closure at the state level to discourage the sending in of the national guard. As such,Brown v. Board was still a small step in desegregating public education.

Many people stood up to fight for the integration of schools. Autherine Lucy was one girl who was admitted to an all white university. When she was suspended, she spoke out against the school and even won the case, but the school still expelled her. Daisy Bates was a member of the NAACP that helped the Little Rock Nine in a case against the school when the governor of Arkansas used the national guard to prevent the African Americans from entering the school. Finally, President Eisenhower also helped fight against segregation in education by sending in paratroopers to help escort the African American students to school and oppose the governors decisions. 

There was a lot of resistance to integration. First, students and the city at the time that the little rock nine tried to enter Central High rioted in protest and bullied and constantly harassed the little rock nine. Governor Oval Faubus of Arkansas was moderate at first but to get reelected he acted against integration. He first used the national guard and then the city guard to attack and prevent the little rock nine from entering the school, and only stopped because of Eisenhower. Especially after the little rock nine graduated, governor Faubus as well as the governor of Virginia shut down their schools in protest of the national guard being sent in. 

I feel very sad about this period of time in history, because seeing so many crowds of white students and governors supporting integration is so far out of the ordinary for today. I wonder what the terrible effects of being bullied and violently harassed had on the students of the little rock nine, and what they must've felt in school. Finally, on important observation for me was President Eisenhower talking about how mob rule shouldn't overturn court rulings, and I think that that is very relevant today.
