# JFK and Civil Rights

## JFK Speech Promoting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
- June 11, 1963
- Says that all Americans should be treated equally, but it isn't the case
- Treat others how you want to be treated, equal rights and equal opportunities
  - African Americans, just because of skin color, can't eat at the same restaurants nor get a good education nor vote
  - Skin color is the only difference, if just cause your skin was black does not mean people should be subject to these things
- President Lincoln freed the slaves 100 years ago, but African Americans are still not fully free, can't be free until all citizens are free

## To what extent was President Kennedy a strong suporter of civil rights?
Although president Kennedy did say in his speech that we've delayed so long, and it is unjust for African Americans to still not be free and live full lives, and he sent legislature to congress opening public facilities to all, President Kennedy only did this from huge pressure by the African American civil disobedience out in the streets, it wasn't too 

## Intermediary
President Kennedy
  - Considers it as a moral issue 
    - Whether to treat others how you wanna be treated
  - Streets to courts
    - Congress must act
    - All public facilities open to public
  
John Lewis
  - There has been to little too late
    - Patience has brought us nothing, politicians haven't done anything
    - No protection against police brutality
  - We need to keep on marching, through the south
  
## Actual
Although president John F. Kenney was morally aligned to equality and freedom for African Americans, John Lewis questions whose side the president is one when JFK asks for a transition from demonstration to the courts.

Although president John F. Kennedy said that inequality was a moral issue, and was aligned on the side with African Americans being equal and free, ultimately, his message that the people should wait and be patient for the courts and congress to figure it out did not fly out well with John Lewis. 

President John F. Kennedy addressed in his speech promoting the Civil Rights act that equality was a moral issue, and that everyone should treat others how they want to be treated (Doc A). This shows that he is morally aligned on the side of African Americans. JFK then mentions that demonstrators should refocus their efforts on the courts, and that he would be sending orders for congress to give African Americans the right to use any public facility (Doc A). While giving African Americans the right to use public facilities shows that he did support civil rights to some degree, it is clear that his actions are reserved, and not in full support of the civil rights movement. John Lewis says that ''patience' is a dirty and nasty word.' For the African Americans, this is true because they have gotten little help from the Democratic or Republican party being patient. Only after they demonstrated did the government respond. So by taking it to the courts, John F. Kennedy is telling them the same thing tat politicians have been telling them, for a hundred years since President Lincoln freed the slaves. Furthermore, we can see that the Kennedy Administration even hoped to calm the speech a bit. John F. Kennedy was not in full support of the civil rights movement, more so than he was pressured into action.

According to John Lewis's speech, the administration's actions were 'too little and too late'. Because John F. Kennedy could definitely have acted faster, and addressed a whole 

John Lewis said that the political parties have strayed from the declaration of independence, and that patience isn't an option to confront these parties. By saying that they should take it into the scourts, Kennedy is telling them to be patient, which has not brought them any results thus far. It is only because of their protesting that Kennedy responded in the first place. Furthmore, in John Lewis's very speech, the Kennedy administration urged him to curb the criticism of the government. This all shows that John F. Kennedy was not in full support of the civil rights movement, mroe so than he was pressured into action.
