## Prompt
Should there be a reparations superfund? To what extend do you agree with this proposal?
- Will this address the problem?
  - What is the problem?
    - The problem is, in the past, African Americans were cheated out of many housing benefits granted only to whites, and even blatantly robbed out of their possessions with contract buying. Event now, Many African American children grow up in families with a lot of issues because of what happened in the past, and it's looking like this trend isn't stopping.
- Who should be eligible to recieve funds?
  - African Americans who have been subject to contract buying, or their children affected as a result. It really should also go to people that were eligible for home owner's association loans, but that was a very long time ago so many people wouldn't be alive today, so instead it should go to try to help with neighborhoods like Chicago struggling with troubling statistcs.
- Who should pay for it?
  - Investors that are still alive that cheated African Americans to pay for more money, also institutions and organizations that clearly had redlining policies towards Americans, such as banks
- Who should administer it?
  - I believe that not just anyone who has been affected by these events, but also anyone that wants to help in general.

## Contract Buyers
- What Happened
  - African Americans were forced to pay usually double or more the cost of a house than white people
  - Most of them weren't even paying a true morgage. What would happen is if they missed a single payment the property wouldn't be theirs anymore and they would get kicked out, with ALL their investment lost.
- Specific Example
  - One African American, to pay back his house, worked multiple jobs everyday, couldn't spend anytime with his family, and is still working hard today
- Strike
  - Some African Americans had enough and banded together to form a strike against the contract buyers league (i think), but even then many still lost their homes and belongings
  
## Excerpts of Reasons for Reparations
- Buying on Contract
  - "Combined the disadvantages of renting with the responsibilities of home ownership"
    - You don't even own your property before payment is done and have to repair anything that breaks with your own money
    - If you lose a payment you lose everything, nothing given back
  - African Americans were prevented from taking regular mortgages
  - Some businessmen would sell the same building three or four times
  - *Analysis*
    - Those businessmen that sold the contracts literally stole money from African Americans. Leading to some having to work overtime to get that money. Not to mention, families of the worker are also robbed of precious time with their family
- Federal Housing Administration
  - FHA insured private mortgages which dropped interest rates and reduced size of downpayment for buying houses
  - System of maps that put white people in 'A' and African Americans in 'D', which meant African Americans didn't get insured and weren't in on one of the biggest oppurtunities to accumulate wealth
    - Aka Redlining
  - *Analysis*
    - African Americans were cheated out of this great deal to accumulate wealth and own a house, and yet whites were allowed to
- Ghettoization
  - Maybe segregation is illegal right now, but in North Lawndale it is 92% Black, triple homicide rate, double infant mortality rate, double the poverty of Chicago's poverty rate, three times number of people on food stamps
  - Chicago has high unemployment and single parents
  - Extreme income gap, 62% of African Americans raised in poor neighborhoods, after a generation nothing changed
  - Blacks born into wealthy neighborhoods fell out of them
  - Regardless of income, black households aren't "Worth as much" as white housholds, 20 times less
  - Blacks are also still restricted in neighborhood, makes 100k lives in 30k neighborhood, and may see their children fall back into that pattern
  - *Analysis*
    - Shows that African American children today are almost equally disadvantaged as they were a generation ago. They are raised by single parents, live in low-income neighborhoods, and since schools and public things come from taxes, this can affect their education! Not to mention that they're still disciminated against, having their households valued less and having their choice of neighborhoods reduced
- G.I. Bill
  - Seemed to be a very fair bill that allowed war veterans to recieve various benefits
  - Article III allowed veterans benefits in low interests on home loans
  - African Americans had to deal with officials at their veteran department, and deal with banks who were already racially profiling the people, making them exempt from this money and interest
  - Housing policy at the time made property value go down when African Americans moved in
- The Home Owners Loan Corporation
  - For buying houses, banks could loan out money requiring people to pay just 10% downpayment, giving a period of 20 to 30 years to pay it off. Instrumental in suburbinization
  - Code of ethics for realtors recommended that they should not introduce African Americans to a neighborhood because it would decrease property value
  - Did not apply to African Americans, only allowed whites to sell to whites, not African Americans
  - Encouraged redlining
  - *Analysis*
    - Once again, African Americans were cheated out of having the ability to own a house and were even locked out of some neighborhoods
- Public Housing
  - Chicago wants to have racial zones for African Americans in 1917, supreme court bans it
  - Chicago reverts to discreet contracts that blocks African Americans from entering
  - *Analysis*
    - African Americans were separated and reduced in their choice of neighborhoods
- White Fight and Flight
  - Whites would terrorize African Americans from entering a neighborhood, and then when that failed they would just run
- Blockbusting and Speculation
  - Blockbusting is making whites believe that their neighborhood would be "overrun" by African Americans to make their houses sell for cheap
  - Investors would sell to African Americans on contract
  
## Draft #1
The problem is, in the past, African Americans were cheated out of many housing benefits granted only to whites, and even blatantly robbed out of their possessions with contract buying. Event now, Many African American children grow up in families with a lot of issues because of what happened in the past, and it's looking like this trend isn't stopping. At the very least, individuals and institutions that profitted or were instrumental in the injustice towards African Americans should pay at the very least those affected, and the neighborhoods that are currently affected. 

First, it is clear that investors robbed many African Americans out of their money during the great migration by forcing them to buy on contract. Contract buying could be described as a mortgage, but one that "Combined the disadvantages of renting with the responsibilities of home ownership." (Excerpts from Ta-Nehisi Coates). Unlike a mortgage, a contract didn't even give you ownership of the house until all payments were made, but losing one payment would forfeit all that was invested in the house, granting investors that sold these homes a dirty profit. But this was more than just a scam, because African Americans were also prevent from recieving regular mortgages, and contracts priced a house much higher than what a white person would've paid for it. This act of investors taking money from African Americans is nothing short of robbery. Clyde Ross, an African American that bought a house during that time had to make up that money and avoid missing a payment by working overtime, losing precious time that he could've spent with his family.

Although one could argue that things are looking better now in 2020, with less racism, segration, and equality, for many cities, this statement simply isn't true. North Lawndale is a neighborhood in Chicago with a 92% black population. The neighborhood faces poverty rates, homicide rates, and poverty rates double or triple the average of the entire city. Many of these children are raised by single parents, an experience that could negatively affect those children growing up. These low income neighborhoods that African Americans were confined to in the past now still result in high income African American families living in low income neighborhoods. Since public services come from taxes, their education is negatively affected. Children might still be worse off than their parents. African American households are valued less than white households. Therefore, for many cities, past inequality has exacerbated present inequity. 

Finally, looking back on history, many African Americans were also denied the same oppurtunities for the accumulation of wealth and home ownership that whites had. One example includes the Federal Housing Association insured private mortgages, which dropped interest rates and reduced the size of downpayment for buying houses. However, they also pioneered redlining, which resulted in black neighborhoods consequently not being able to recieve any of this insurance whatsoever. Furthermore, the Home Owners Loan Corporation allowed banks to loan money to people that were looking to buy homes, but only allowed whites to sell to whites, leaving blacks cheated out of a golden oppurtunity. The G.I. bill tried to help veterans recieve home benefits, but yet black veterans had to deal with banks and officials that discriminated against them. Policies and organizations which were so instrumental in suburbinization did not help African Americans at all.

African Americans were subject to the injustices of contract buying, were denied benefits granted to whites, and are suffering presently from those inequalities. Thus, the should be a reparations fund, given first to those that were subject to contract buying and then to ghettoized neighborhoods that are currently struggling, funded by individuals such as investors and organizations that discriminated and cheated African Americans.
