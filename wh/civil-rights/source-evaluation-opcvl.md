## Ann Moody Excerpt
Before I demonstrated, I had written Mama. She wrote me back a letter, begging me not to take part in the sit-in. She even sent ten dollars for bus fare to New Orleans. I didn'thave one penny, so I kept the money. Mama's letter made me mad. I had to live my life as I saw fit. I had made that decision when I left home. But it hurt to have my family prove to me how scared they were. It hurt me more than anything else----I knew the whites had already started the threats and intimidations. I was the first Negro from my hometown who had openly demonstrated, worked with the NAACP, or anything. When Negroes threatened to do anything in Centreville, they were either shot like Samuel O'Quinn or run out of town like Reverend Dupree. 

I didn't answer Mama's Letter. Even if I had written one, she wouldn't have received it before she saw the news on TV or heard it on the radio. I waited to hear from her again. And I waited to hear in the news that someone in Centreville had been murdered. If so, I knew it would be a member of my family.

The origin of this content is Anne Moody, who wrote this excerpt in her autobiography and  published it in 1968. It holds a lot of purpose because it gives us a point of view of an African American college student during the civil rights movement. The purpose of this excerpt was to talk about some of the dangers that demonstrators faced in opposition to the movement, which is important because it means that the civil rights movement was not a one-sided story. In the excerpt, Ann talks about how her mother didn't want her to go because the hometown that she was from would threaten African Americans to stop in response to their protesting, which is valueable because it sheds light on the things that happened behind the scenes in the civil rights movement. 

Some limitations of the origin of the source is that it was an autobiography by a student that was part of the demonstrations, which means that not all the information may be true or may be biased towards the side of demonstrators during the civil rights movement. This combined with the purpose of the source makes it questionable. The content of the source made it seem like her family would be targetted and harmed, but we don't know if that actually really did happen to her family, or if it was just paranoia.
