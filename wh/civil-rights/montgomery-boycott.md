## Writeup

The Montgomery Bus Boycott was successful because it encompassed a very long period of time, had strong and central figures and leadership, and was nonviolent at heart while still being impactful. Even before Rosa Parks was arrested, before the start of the boycotts, Jo Ann Robinson had sent a letter to the mayor of Montgomery. In it, she talked about how at the time, many African Americans were already starting to carpool to avoid humiliation on buses, and there were talks of a boycott (Doc B). The actual Montgomery Bus Boycott itself lasted a very long time, from December of 1955 to December of 1956 (Montgomery Bus Boycott Timeline). During this time, in order to impact the bus company that had three quarters African American passengers (Doc B), the African American community had to make tremendous sacrifices. These sacrifices included carpooling and walking as an alternative. In one case, two African American men walked 7 and 14 miles each day (Doc C). According to Martin Luther King Jr., because the boycott was nonviolent, the movement was part of democracy, and one could be honest when talking about the movement (Doc E). The African American community was also supported by strong leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr., who encouraged his followers even after he was jailed (Doc A), and Rosa Parks herself, having gone to Highlander School, a school that trained civil rights acitivists and helped her experience what nondiscrimination could be like (Doc D).
