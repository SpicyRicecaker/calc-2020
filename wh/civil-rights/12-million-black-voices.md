## Answers
[How was life in the south]
In the south, life for African Americans was extremely difficult. As can be seen from the pictures in Richard Wrights book, African Americans had little to no belongings, the clothes that they wore were extremely tattered. The barracks that they slept in were incredibly cramped with many people to one room and little padding and blankets. Richard writes about how an African American going against the laws would be fined and be forced to pay it off through working for plantation owners, presumably referring to vagrancy laws and black codes. Even war veterans, just coming back from serving in the United States army, could be lynched while still in uniform. African Americans did not own any land, and did not have many material belongings in the south.

[What reasons for moving up]
The main reason that African Americans wanted to move north was the hope of a better life. Richard Wright wrote "When a man lives upon the land and is cold and hungry and hears word of the great factories going up in the cities, he begins to hope and dream of a new life, and he leaves." These new factories that sprung up as a result of war lead to requirement of labour, and news from the north is that life would be better, the buildings would be better, there would be better jobs, much less discrimination and even education. African American newspapers spoke of the good news in the north, and even friends that went on ahead to first go into the cities wrote about how good life was.

[Life in the cities]
Wright described life in the north as kind of a dream for African Americans, in northern cities there were no signs saying blacks only, there were actually foreigners living in cities, and many whites were neutral and indifferent towards them. However, Wright described city life as hard and sometimes events are harder to see, as compared to the south where things are slow and tied to the weather. 
However, African Americans faced many difficulties in the north, there wasn't enough housing for them to go around and they had to compete with poor migrant white families who also moved up to the north for housing. The houses that they could live in would be outside of business areas or unhealthy next to the exhaust of factories.

[Thoughts, Observations, Feelings]
I found it incredible how so many millions of African Americans were able to move to the north, 1,500,000 in 1890, in 2,000,000 in 1900, and 3,500,000 in 1920. I wonder what the effect of this shift in labour from the south to the north had on the landowners of the south at the time. Another passage that I found really moving was Richard Wright describing the symbolic significance that the Ohio River had on him, describing it as "a symbol, a line that runs through our hearts, dividin hope from the nation", and it paints a picture of the feelings of hope and excitement that African Americans had as they were immigrating into northern cities for the first time.
