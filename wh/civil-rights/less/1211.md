## 1963 Debrief
  - Picture of Firefighters spraying a hose with high pressure at people
  - Must a nonviolent movement provoke a violent backlash in order to achieve its goals?
    - Some people say "violence with violence"
    - The importance of the media
    - e.g.
      - Violent backlash makes it a lot quicker, getting media attention is good but it takes a long while to do anything
      - Violence is not needed, but it does provoke other, Martin Luther King used words to influence other people
      + Humans want it done fast, today is "microwave generation", past wasn't
      + The police force was ordered by the government to spray the public, when people saw the violence it bothered them a lot and forced change upon them
      - Martin Luther King led a march in some places that were very segregated and did it in a very unviolent way, so it would be possible to get opinions past
  - Many people wanted to make change a lot faster and better, people disagreed with JFK, is critisizing the government good or bad?
    - People should be critisizing the government, already strained relationship between civil rights protesters and JFK
  - The move to launch the children's march was contentious. Do you think children should have been involved in the Birmingham campaign?
    - Students missed school, ended up going to jails of other countries
    - Some thinks it's fine, because children marching wouldn't be a bad thing, children in high schools should be able to act on their own opinions
    - Jail cells were filled up, students should participate because it raised a ton of attention
    - TV was out, 15 minutes local 15 minutes national, people saw that at the time
  - What is the role of the media in exposing injustice and influencing public opinion?
    - Free exposure, but sometimes people take it out of context
      - Nonviolence in the beginning, but as time moves on it becomes violent, media only covers violence, peoples impression is swayed as a result
      - Think about what happened today
    - [ ] give concrete examples of what happened and your analysis of it
    - Were officerse that were violent, but officers that were peaceful, huge lawsuit against officers now
    - No video evidence back then in 1963 Birmingham, but now that we actually have video it makes it much more obvious and evident
    + Becomes very important to discern the truth and talk about violence, one person's account is not enough and physically go down there and figure out the truth instead of relying on the media, job of the media is to inform people but nowadays the media does the thinking for the people almost
    + Ignorance if you don't look at multiple perspectives
