## Sit-ins and Freedom Rides

That the public schools in the south were not abiding by the rules of brown vs board

Arkansas little rock nine are teenagers

Sit ins for college people, stools at the counter, occupy all the stools since they were bad, put a lot of pressure on restaurants to serve them

Prepared for pushing and shoving, fighting would happen

Freedom rides are a little bit different because they are buses, charter buses, goes across interstate lines
- e.g. going from oregon to seattle
- crossing interstate lines
- by law the buses should've been desegregated in interstate travel
  - was segregation still happening?
  - were the bus companies bad?
