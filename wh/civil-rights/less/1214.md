## Freedom Summer National Public Opinion Poll
- Harris Survey Inc.
- July 6th 1964
- 2:1 disfavor efforts of northern students to push for civil rights in Mississipi
- 72%:28% favor President Johnson sending in federal troops to restore peace, even in the south this is 52%:48%
- 78%:22% favor use to federal troops if state authorities resisted the desegregation of schools
- White southerners support it 54%:46%
- Four times as many voters said that they would think more of the president if he sent troops to Mississipi
- White southerners could lose votes for the south, as much as 60%
- TL;DR People support American president using authority to enforce court desegregation, but generally dissaprove of student movement in Mississipi 
- "This summer white and Negro students are going to Mississippi to organize Negroes to vote. Do you generally approve of this move or disapprove of it?"

## Answer
1. Freedom Summer National Public Opinion Poll
2. The results of the poll showed that, in 1964, while a 2:1 majority of Americans didn't approve of The Freedom the student movement in Mississippi, 72% of the Americans supported the idea of the president sending in troops to restore peace if needed. In the south, the support for the president to suppress violence was lower, being 54% instead. This suggests that most of the public didn't support the movement in 1964, but even more so they disapproved of violence (the south less so). Slightly unrelated was that 78% of Americans also supported the president using force to desegregate schools. 
3. "The American public, by an overwhelming 2 to 1, views with disfavor the efforts of northern students to push for civil rights for Negroes in Mississippi"
4. Seeing that more than two thirds of Americans did not support the Freedom Summer, and yet 78% supported the president using force to desegregate schools is very surprising to me. I wonder if this difference is that a majority of people are opposed to change. What was also incredibly alarming to me was the fact that the south was half and half split on basically whether federal authority should take precedence over state authority. I wonder what the numbers would look like now, and how the numbers have changed.
