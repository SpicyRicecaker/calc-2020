# “No Easy Walk" Birmingham, 1963

## What strategies did civil rights activists use in their effort to transform Birmingham, AL?
  - MLK involved children in protests by taking them out of school in May 7th
    - Children were sent to jail as a result
  - News at the time had 15 minutes of national news, 15 minutes of local news. Marching only one block could fill every single newspaper and news station
    - This manipulation of the news captured national attention and even went into worldwide news
  - In the 15th day of protest in the city, 2500 children were jailed and the city jails filled. As a result city began to negotiate
    - Merchants desegregated as a result

## What kind of resistance did they encounter?
  - In the first protest kids were jailed and sent off to jail in schoolbuses
  - Bull Connor, the city's police chief, was very much against integration
    - Sent in canines (dogs) to scare and attack protesters
    - Ordered the fire department to spray people with hoses
      - 100 PPI, water hit with enough force to knock bark off trees
  - KKK met and bombed birmingham building
  - Police then beat blacks
  - People were afraid that the march on washington would become violent, Attorney Robert Kennedy who supported the civil rights movement tried to prevent march
  - The 16th street baptist church was a place where students met to discuss civil rights. It was bombed, and 15 people were injured and 4 children killed

## How did King respond to the charge that the protests in Birmingham were “unwise and untimely”?  What rationale did King offer for his actions?
- Every African American had been told to wait, but Martin Luther King said that "Justice too long delayed is justice denied"

## What compromises were civil rights leaders pressured to make in pursuit of their goal?
- Martin Luther King was told to leave the city of Birmingham and just wait when he tried to organize a protest 
- During the march on Washington, John Lewis of SNCC wanted to give a speech, but in the script he criticized the Kennedy administration
  - Phillip A. Randolph who had been hoping for this march on Washington for much of his life pleaded to John Lewis to make it less serious, as a result the criticism was toned down

## What is the media’s role in exposing injustice and influencing public opinion?
- The media often highlights and focuses on the extreme ends of the news, as it captures the most attention and as a result earns them more money. In the Birmingham protests the media did cover the marches somewhat but news about the violent means that Bull Connor used against the protesters and the bombings that took place had a huge impact on public opinion.

## Must a nonviolent movement provoke a violent backlash in order to achieve its goals?  What other strategies could the protesters have used to expose the violence and injustice of segregation?
A nonviolent movement does not need to provoke a violent backlash in order to achieve its goals. For example, students getting sent to jail for civil disobedience could not be considered violent backlash. However, the use of force against protesters or the bombings of the KKK and white supremacist groups fanned the flame and rapidly spread awareness of the issue and accelerated the movement. Protesters could have encouraged people to vote more insted, and talk about the bad things happening, which would still be an effective method but just not as fast.
