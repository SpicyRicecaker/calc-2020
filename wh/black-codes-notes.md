## How radical was Congressional Reconstruction?
- What does this mean in your own words? Does this indicate radical change? Moderate reform? Why do you think so? 
> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  
> &mdash; Amendment XIII Section 1, The Reconstruction Amendments

This demonstrates radical change, because abolishing slavery is huge and breaking a norm of the old government. It was what the civil war was fought for.

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.
> &mdash; Amendment XIV Section 1 The Civil Rights Act of 1866

All people being born in the USA being a citizen and having equal rights is a very big radical change as it allowed for other people to migrate over into the US and resulted in a diverse population in the country today

> Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State
> &mdash; Amendment XIV Section 2 The Civil Rights Act of 1866

This is a moderate change and a tweak to the existing government. 

> all persons born in the United States... hereby declared to be citizens of the United States...shall have same right... and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens 
> &mdash; Civil Rights Act of 1866

This was a huge radical change, as it basically says that everyone born on American soil and living in the US has completely equal rights regardless of who they are, so there shouldn't be any racism in the country. 

### Overall Answer
- What is your overall answer? How radical was Congressional Reconstruction? Why do you think so?

The Congressional Reconstruction was very radical because it brought forth many radical ideas such as abolishing slavery and granting equal rights to all citizens born on American soil. First, in the 13th amendment section 1, it was written that "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude...shall exist within the United States" unless it is as a punishment. This was a huge radical change because it was what the entire Civil war and President Lincoln was fighting for. Freedom for everyone in the United States, not just for specific, rich landowners. Second, in the 14th amendment section 1, it was written that all people born in America are citizens and that all citzens should have equal rights regardless of race. This is a huge change also because it meant that racism in the state is now supposedly not allowed, and if it was followed through then the diverse population of people in our country today would be treated equally.
