## Summary
- The Great Leap Forward was a plan set out by Mao Zedong to try and boost China's industrialization and economy to the standards of other nations. Within it contained plans to force people's communes over private lands, eradicate the four pests, change agricultural techniques, and move to iron and steel production. Each and every single one of these plans ended badly and resulted in crop yield going down. First was the illusion of superabundance, in which inferiors reported to superiors inflated crop harvest estimates to make it seem like people's communes were a success. This lead to officials feasting on food that they realistically didn't have, and even go as far as to move production to other types of crops as there was a grain shortage. The four pests eradication plan lead to birds dying which resulted in a huge number of insects swarming all over the plants. The new agricultural techniques were bad and they worsened crop output. All this while, farmers were encouraged to drop their tools and instead mine for iron to produce steel instead.

## Research Question
 - Focus on government inadequacy:
   - To what extent did the way that the government was set up allow for all of this to happen?
    - Censorship, no freedom of the press
    - Fear of punishment from higher officials
  - To what extent did the actions of government officials contribute to the Great Chinese Famine?
    - Overestimation of crop yield
      - Oversplurging of food
      - Planting of non-grain plants
      - Move from agriculture to mining
  - To what extent did the overestimation of crop yield by government officials contribute to the starvation of people in the Great Chinese Famine?
  
## Explanation
From my initial research, it seems that the Great Chinese Famine was caused by the Great Leap Forward, a plan proposed by Mao Zedong to bring up the economy of China to other nations. Within it included a variety of reformations that all ended in disaster, such as the elimination of pests like birds which led to the takeover of insects, new agricultural techniques that were ineffective, and a push to mine iron over planting crops. 

What really stood out to me was how officials falsely reported inflated harvests even while yield was decreasing, and how "starvation" was treated by officials as a conspiracy. 

There seems to be a mountain of mistakes that the Chinese Communist Party made, and I really want to find out **why** officials were able to act this way. Would freedom of the press have changed the way that officials acted? Or maybe democracy?

I don't really know which one of these is for the best...

**To what extent did censorship allow for government officials to falsely report inflated harvests in the Great Chinese Famine?**

**To what extent did censorship affect the actions of government officials during the Great Chinese Famine?**

**To what extent did censorship affect Mao Zedong's implementation of the Great Leap Forward during the Great Chinese Famine?**
