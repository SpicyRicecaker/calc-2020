## Notes - Black Power during Reconstruction, 1868
- It is known that Johnson gave back much of the land that was confiscated from plantation owners back to them and let them be super lenient, which led to them imposing black codes and slavery in another name
> "Black people organized into Union Leagues, defending each other from white attacks and organizing boycotts and strikes to prevent plantation owners from imposing slavery-like conditions. They organized black political conventions across the South to demand the right to vote, schools, fair wages and land. They marched, protested, and flooded Congress with petitions and resolutions. Their efforts were successful"

## Black Power Writing

  - In 1866, right after the end of the civil war, the reconstruction of the country is starting

  - How did African Americans impact the reconstruction, and what happened as a result? 
  - African Americans impacted the reconstruction through nonviolent freedom of expression, through conventions, and by making their voice heard. As a result, they were able to pass many laws that benefitted the working class and got them started away from their lives as former slaves. This is in spite of the fact that during this time they were being oppressed by plantation owners who wanted slavery back in another name and did this through the black codes.

In spite of the fact that many African Americans were unfairly oppressed by the black codes that their former owners passed, African Americans were able to shape Reconstruction in significant ways, most notably through making their voices heard and in conventions. 

First, they stopped congress from under representing their voice through activism. Even as unfair laws were being passed in southern states that made it illegal for black people to work for themselves and have their own voice, the freedmen organized "boycots and strikes to prevent plantation owners from imposing slavery-like conditions," (Sanchez 2). Through their loud voice, congress was inclined to respond and allow states to hold their own conventions with freed voices and the 14th amendment in mind, instead of letting southern delegates unfairly represent them.

Next, through these conventions, many black voices that were previously unheard now could impact the law. The Mississipi, Alabama, and South Carolina conventions were able to pass laws that let blacks recieve their deserved payment from their former plantation owners, such as tax shifts and pay for work, and also helped them get a plot of land that they could work on. The conventions were also able to allow African Americans to serve in public office, instituted free public schools, and advocated for their civil rights.

If it were not for the active voices of the African Americans in the reconstruction, then civil rights, activism, and the diverse country we live in today would not be as we know it.
