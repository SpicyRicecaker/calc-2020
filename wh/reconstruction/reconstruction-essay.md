Although Reconstruction was very radical in terms of and constitutional reform, in the end, federal incompetence in enforcing these rules along with the reign of local extremist groups paved away for years of future suffering.

Right after the civil war ended, a very unfortunate thing happened: Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. As a result, Andrew Johnson was elected to be president. Now Andrew Johnson basically made reconstruction extremely slow, and allowed southern states to rejoin the union with extremely little consequences. This lead to the black codes being created [Insert quote about how black codes took away the rights of black people to make a living for themselves, speak for themselves, and even arm themselves]. These black codes severely compromised the civil rights of freed blacks, almost to the point of slavery. It was the exact opposite of democracy.

On the other hand, one could argue that Congress really did make reconstruction a success. And this is true, because the amendments to the law that congress made were the saving grace of the reconstruction. By passing the [13th, 14th, 15th amendment, along with the civil right act], African Americans were able to vote for the first time and hold positions in office, albeit, only for a short amount of time. Because these rules were never held fully enforced at all. The next paragraph kind of refutes this.

The south had this misguided conception that they had a lost cause. [cite article here] This basically shows that they believed that their cause was just but they lost in military might. This eventually lead to white supremacist groups, namely the K.K.K. along with other groups that terrorized the south literally following the radical acts of congress. [Quote of blacks getting attacked by the K.K.K.] The wealthy whites of the south also influenced poor whites to have a zero sum belief in that whatever the blacks gained they lost. Thereby the cause for these attacks. The free speech rights of the African Americans being affected was another huge indicator of how reconstruction failed. By being so violent in the polls, so called "redeemer groups" silenced voters and delegates alike. [Insert quote of a candidate trying to talk and getting shouted down.] Finally, and perhaps the most alarming of reconstruction was the disputed presidential election. As a republican president was being elected, congress had to promise to withdraw federal troops from the south, dooming the south to be plagued by centuries to southern white terror.

In the end, while construction was a huge leap in ideals, the lack of enforcement and persistence in the beginning would lead to many more years of civil injustice and hard battles to win them back.
