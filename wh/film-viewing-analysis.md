## Quotes

Part I

> H. L. Gates references “a southern writer” who observed that “Only at the moment when Lee handed Grant his sword was the Confederacy born.” 
 
> Gregory Downs “As it becomes clear that they’re not going to call upon any rebel state congressmen, Democrats start to jump up and to scream, “This is revolution!” In fact, they were right. It was a revolution. 
 
> Eric Foner “[The massacres in Memphis and New Orleans] was sort of the logical outcome of Johnson’s reconstruction plan. When you say blacks really have no rights whatsoever, you are encouraging an atmosphere which does not feel, to use a modern phrase, that black lives matter very much.”
 
> H.L. Gates “Congress laid out strict new terms: the rebel states had to adopt new constitutions, give black men the right to vote, elect new state governments, and ratify the 14th Amendment. Then and only then would they be readmitted to Congress.” 
 
> Kimberlé Krenshaw “For a time, the interests of the Freedmen and the interests of the Republican party were in step with one another.”

Part II

> Heather Cox Richardson “If you were one of these black men who were elected to congress it was your time; the future must have seemed limitless.” 
 
> Shawn Alexander “Violence has always been here, and goes side by side in American history to the creation of a white supremacist racial ideology that has driven us all the way from slavery to the present day.” 
 
> Allen Guelzo “The difficulty was going to turn out to be persistence.” 
 
> John Stauffer “[Frederick] Douglass recognized that if you rewrite the story of the war, that can have profound implications for race relations.”
