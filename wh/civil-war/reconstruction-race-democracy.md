# To what extent did African Americans achieve full and equal citizenship in the half century after the Civil War? 

Even though African Americans made significant strides in their rights from enslavement and racism, ultimately, their rights were limited and had to be fought for thereafter.

Through the incredibly progressive 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, for a time, African American men were able to vote and hold office (An African American Majority in the South Carolina Legislature, African American Men in Government). However, at the same time confederate whites and other racist people started to put more and more restrictions on African Americans. The Cornerstone speech is a good example of this, as even though equal laws were passed many people did not have equal views. The confederate south also started to pass the Black Codes, which were really slavery in another name. Not to mention, the long and unfair tests for voting only given to African Americans, as well as opression of voters by whites. Finally, Plessy v. Ferguson established that segregation was ok since it was separate and equal, but now we know that this is not the case. In conclusion, there were tremendous strides, but also steps back for every move forward.
