# How does history impact the way people see themselves and others? Give an example of racial identity and how it formed using the history of South Africa
History has a huge impact on the way that people see themselves and others, as can be seen from the Afrikaner's history with issues related to race. First, British rule of the Afrikaners and their emphasis on class based rule made Afrikaners bitter about this system. The Great Trek out of Cape Colony was arduous, yet as a result the Afrikaners were able to establish their own independent government with racism. Finally, the victory of the Battle of the Blood River made Afrikaners see themselves as favored subjects of God. They were able to win battles and triumph over hardships with a segregated system, so while it is unacceptable, one conceive of how they were able to setup the Apartheid and hold themselves in a higher regard than Africans.
