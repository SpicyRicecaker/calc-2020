# What effect did the arrival of Europeans in South Africa have on the Africans who lived there?
The arrival of Europeans in the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa had a largely negative impact on the Africans who lived there. At first the Europeans were relatively peaceful and traded with the Khoisan, but after the expansion of their territory, many Africans had their land taken from them and cattle solen. Some of them then had to work for them or maybe even captured as slaves for the Europeans. In addition to this, the Europeans also brought with them diseases that killed many Africans as well. Europeans thrived at the complete expense of South Africans
