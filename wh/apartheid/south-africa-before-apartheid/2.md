# How did the mineral revolution lay the groundwork for racial segregation in South Africa?
The fundamental concept of making a large margin of profit by oppressing a race and the moethods by which African miners were forced to work were distinctly related to the qualities of racial segregation during Apartheid. First, land was seized from Africans and they were taxed severely, forcing migrant miners to come work in the mines. During the Apartheid, the land that non-white Africans had was just 13%. Next, miners were issued passes, that basically forced them to either work or be bounced back in the area that they came form. These passes were also issued to workers during the Apartheid. Finally, the barracks were overcrowded and badly maintained, causing health issues. This dehumanization was widespread throughout Apartheid. Before the Mineral Revolution, the society was ruled by a class based system, but due to the shift to a race based system, "Africans became poor in ways they had not been before mining began."
