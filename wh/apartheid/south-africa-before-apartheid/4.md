# What do you believe was the biggest source of tension between groups in South Africa in the early 20th century? Explain your reasoning
I believe that the biggest source of tension between groups in South Africa had to do with control over the mines that resulted from the mineral revolution. This is because, the British wanted to control these diamond and gold mines because it would bring them wealth, but the ones occupying the mines were the Afrikaners. It was basically a power struggle.
