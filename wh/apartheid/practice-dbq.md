The lives of of non-White South Africans were negatively affected in many ways by the Apartheid. First of all, they were barred from having access to facilities such as the zoo, or even if they did, it would be limited and often overcrowded. Second, non-White South Africans had to deal with intense segregation in public transportation, forced to use only a fraction of seats on buses buses even when they were empty, losing them time. Finally, children in this society were conditioned to believe that this segregation was normal and accespted.

## B
Africans
  - Their maid outfit and standing show that they were to have inferior jobs in contrast to whites
  - Outside park on the side walk contrasts the environments in which they lived in
White
  - Well dressed, head buried in newspaper
  - were perfectly fine as a result of the African's prescnence
  Children
    - Oblivious to this 

The big inconspicuos sign saying "This section of the park is used for whites only" is very obvious, and represents how outright segregated the socity in South Africa was. This is further expanded by the contrast between the colorful park and the empty sidewalk. The maid outfit of the South African woman, in contrast to the white main in a suit sitting shows the difference in job opportunity and expectancy that they would take inferior jobs.
