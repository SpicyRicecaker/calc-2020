### What influence did Gandhi have in South Africa?

### Fill in the following chart.

- Year Implemented
- Purpose of Act

#### Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act
Implemented in 1949, specified that there were to be no marriages between whites and any other races. This was intended to keep races separate

#### Population Registration Act
Implemented in 1950, it separated all races in Africa to white, colored, or African, and the African and colored races were further subdivided. This was for the purpose of "dividing and conquering" the colored people and preventing communication and free speech between theese races.

#### Group Areas Act
Implemented in 1950, it designated every inch of land in South Africa to a specific race. The white race was given 86% of the land and all the best land, while non-whites, who made up 80% of the population, only got 14% of the land. This obviously helped the whites at the expense of non-whites, while separating the races

#### Suppression of Communism Act
Implmeneted in 1950, it defined communism so broadly that anyone could get banned from meeting or speaking. 
> "Communism'...includes...any doctrine or scheme...which aims at bringing about any political, industrial, social, or economic change within the Union by the promotion of disturbance or disorder."

### What was the purpose of the Defiance Campaign?
The purpose of the Defiance Campaign was trying to get the government to repeal the Natives Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents act, which was passed in 1952 and increased the amount of information on passports. It was inspired by Gandhi's principle of *Satygahara* and aimed to flood the system with prisoners without passes.

### Why did the various anti-apartheid groups join together as the Congress Alliance?
The various groups joined forces because the Defiance Campaign showed that there was much power to be had in strength, and working together against the government instead of against each other or individually. 

### How did the government respond to the Freedom Charter?
The government sent in police to search the delgates, scan the scene, and confiscate documents.

### What did the Alexandra bus boycott show both apartheid supporters and protesters?
The Alexandra bus boycott was the peoples response to an increased fare on buses. By making a sacrifice to not ride the bus and walk and bike in some cases up to twenty miles a day, the bus company eventually relaxed fares. It showed that African Americans had levarage if they were able to economically impact African Americans.

### Why were PAC leaders unhappy with the ANC? Give three reasons. 
a. The PAC believed the ANC did nothing in the 4 years of time that they were jailed for
b. They claimed that the ANC was an elitist organization because it did not tap into black dissatisfaction
c. Rejected the thought that South Africa was for all including black and white

### Why did the protest at Sharpeville become violent? Was someone at fault? Explain.
Africans were frustrated by everything happening to them, bad education, bad living condition, bad job opportunities, police raids. They clashed with the police in small ways. When more than 5000 protesters surrounded the police station, police panicked and shot at the protesters. While one could argue that the police might've been in a really high pressure situation, there is no justification for the massacre of hundreds of protesters shot in the back that ensued.
