This mob threw stones and started to close on the police, and furthermore, was the first to fire three shots at the police.

In source B, many people of all races can be seen on a march, some carrying signs, protesting against apartheid. The sheer number and diversity of people suggests that there were many people interested on the issue of Apartheid in South Africa.

With the addition of cranes and boxes, it seems that the people were gathered near a port, which shows that one way the international community wanted to protest against apartheid was preventing the importing and exporting of goods from South Africa. Two other signs are visible, one of which states "70 dead" and another "apartheid means murder", which shows that people see apartheid as violent and bloody.
